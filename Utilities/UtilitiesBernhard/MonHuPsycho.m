function [wfm,profile] = MonHuPsycho(Pitch, Vel, Om, SDur, SampRate, ModDep, Display); 
% This function generates a waveform with a monaural huggins pitch at Pitch
% Pitch is in Hz
% Vel = for instance [2 4 8 16 32] Hz;
% Om = for instance [.25 0.5 1 2 4] cyc/oct;

% Direction... [-1 1]? For now, we use the same direction for the lower 
% & upper halves. Might consider what happens when 1st and 2nd halves are 
% in opposite directions. It would make the case that it's really the
% discontinuity and not something about the ST content that creates teh
% pitch. 

% Hard coded values. Could easily be put in argument list

% Lowest freq, bandwidth etc. Hard coded BW is 200Hz - Vel to 12800Hz + Vel
% +/- Vel because AM adds sidebands. 
baseF = 200; 
BW = 6;
