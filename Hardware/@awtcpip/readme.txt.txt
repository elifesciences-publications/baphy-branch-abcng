
There are four files in this folder that were used in Matlab 7. 

fread.m
fwrite.m
init.m
awtcpip.m

These files were slightly modified to run under Matlab 6.5.

To run daqpc under Matlab 7, you need to use the files with the name _Orig in them (init_Orig.m, fread_Orig.m
fwrite_Orig.m, and awtcpip_Orig.m).
