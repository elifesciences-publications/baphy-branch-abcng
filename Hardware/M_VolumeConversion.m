function out = M_VolumeConversion(in,direction,Microphone)
% VolumeConversion converts between SPL [dB] and Voltage
% at the output of the Etymotic Research ER7C microphone amp.
%
%  The logarithmic relationship
%
%    SPL_1rel0 [dB] = 20 * log_10 (V1/V0)
%
%  between the relative Sound Pressure Level (SPL_1rel0) in dB units and V1 
%  with respect to the base voltage V0 is assumed. Absolute SPLs are attained 
%  by adding SPL_1rel0 and SPL(V0), which was 94dB in this case. 
%  The corresponding V0 = RMS of a Sine (@1000Hz,X dB), 
%   where X depends on the calibration system.
%
% Measurement Setup for:
% - Etymotic ER-7C
%  The well defined probe tone (1000Hz, 94dB)is generated 
%  in the little hole on the upper right hand.
%  The rubber recording tube has to be inserted into this tube for calibration.
%  The switch under "Output" produces two probe tones:
%   Setting:  '0'    :  corresponds to 94dB (Typical value for V0: 0.049)
%   Setting: '-20' :  corresponds to 74 dB (Typical value for V0: 0.005)
% 
% - BK 4944 A
%  Amplification set to 10x
%
%  The measured voltage was sent to a NIDAQ-card, 
%  where it was digitized and measured.
